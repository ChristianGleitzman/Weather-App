# Weather Web App

This is a personal project for a weather web app that utilizes the weather API from weatherapi.com to display the current weather and forecast for a specific location entered by the user. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- weatherapi.com API

## Skills Developed

- DOM Manipulation: The project involves using JavaScript to dynamically update the content of the webpage based on user input and the data retrieved from the weather API.

- API Integration: Integrating an external API into a web application requires understanding how to make HTTP requests and parse the data returned by the API.

- Responsive Design: The project incorporates CSS to make the web app responsive to window size.

- Error Handling: The project includes error handling to handle cases where the user enters an invalid location or if there is an error retrieving data from the weather API.

## How to Use the App
1) Open the index.html file in a web browser.
2) Enter the name of a location (e.g. "New York", "Paris") in the input field and click the "Search" button.
3) The app will display the current weather and forecast for the specified location.

Note: The app uses the weather API from weatherapi.com, which has a free and paid plan. If you encounter issues with the app, it is possible that the free plan has exceeded its daily usage limits. You may need to create an account with weatherapi.com and use a paid plan to access the API without restrictions.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing geolocation to automatically retrieve the user's location and display the weather for that location without the need for the user to input it manually.
- Adding additional features such as the ability to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit units, or to view weather conditions for multiple locations at once.
- Improving the user interface and design to make the app more visually appealing.
